						<p class="intro">
								We’re at a pivotal moment in the development of the global digital currency industry. Rules and policies around digital currency will continue to emerge. The BitLicense is the first new rule-set written to address this industry. Today, as a template for other state, federal or international rule-making, it would be devastating for the industry. </p>

						<p class="intro">
								Clarifying the scope of business activity covered by the BitLicense to exclude software creators and mining operators, taking a risk-based or tiered approach to FI’s that are licensed, reducing the burden of business approval and reporting, and normalizing the AML requirements with Federal expectations would go a long way to improving the BitLicense and making it something that could, in fact, support this nascent, dynamic, and innovative global industry.</p>

						</div>
						<p class="intro">
								As written, compliance is impossible. It’s as if we’ve just learned that the earth does in fact revolve around the sun, but others are insisting that we fix the sun so it revolves around them.</p>
						<p class="intro">
								And even if compliance was possible, it would probably be possible for only a handful of well-funded companies which would mean no ecosystem could develop, and it would come at the expense of consumers controlling their own money, which would defeat the purpose of the entire endeavor.</p>
						<p class="intro">
								This is why we’re hoping for better — the principle-based policy I 	mentioned, and time to innovate on actual consumer protections. I would never bet against innovation, so I remain optimistic about creative solutions. Yet we’re also preparing for reality under the existing proposal. “Reality” currently means eliminating New York residents from our services, and collaborating with colleagues at similar companies planning the same. Is this a scalable solution? Possibly not, if counterparty requirements are applied even to on-chain recipients, or if other states or countries mimic BitLicense mistakes.</p>

						<p class="intro">
								The stakes for bitcoin are incredibly high around the New York BitLicense regulations, which, if enacted exactly as proposed, shatters the foundation of bitcoin for anyone globally doing business in New York or with a resident of New York anywhere in the world, with incredible provisions like 10 years of record-keeping and a prohibition on bitcoin businesses keeping any of their profits in bitcoin – which given that bitcoin is legal to own is almost certainly unconstitutional.</p>

						<p class="intro">
								First, designate a “Startup Onramp,” or a period of time during which new companies are not subject to the regulation. No small company with $20K of funding from an accelerator like Y Combinator is going to be able to afford the hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even millions, needed for compliance. This could even be based on valuation or transaction volume so as to protect small, bootstrapped startups.</p>
						<p class="intro">Second, create an exception for de minimis amounts of virtual currency transmission, say, for transactions under $500 and accounts under $3,000, so that small companies doing small transactions could stay afloat without being saddled with massive compliance costs.</p>
						<p class="intro">Lastly, clarify that these rules are only to cover companies that are holding users’ money in the way a bank would, such as wallet services or exchanges, and not just to anyone building technology in the space.</p>

						Re: Comments on Proposed Rulemaking regarding Regulation of the Conduct of Virtual 
Currency Businesses

						<div class="author">

							Fred Ehrsam, President and Co-Founder, Coinbase
						</div>
						<p class="intro">
								 To summarize the main points of our response: </br>
1. We feel the BitLicense is duplicative of the current money transmitter regulations which are a more appropriate form of regulation for the future of digital currency.</br>
2. Certain aspects of the proposed recordkeeping and anti-money laundering requirements would eliminate the core utility of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, substantially hindering the innovation which all of us including, purportedly the NYDFS, find so promising.</br>
3. Any regulation of virtual currencies at this stage should take care to exclu de non-financial use cases and companies who are not storing Bitcoin on behalf of customers.</p>
<p class="intro">
While we applaud the NYDFS for being forward thinking on virtual currencies, we feel the proposed BitLicense falls short of its stated goal of balancing customer protection and rooting out illegal activity while encouraging innovation.  We remain cautiously optimistic that the NYDFS will work to reach a more appropriate balance that recognizes Bitcoin as a rapidly evolving technology.

							Bobby Lee - BTC China, Lin Li - Huobi, Mingxing Xu - OKCoin
						</div>
						<p class="intro">
								 By defining “virtual currency business activity” as the conduct of certain activities with “a” New York resident, the BitLicense Proposal would arguably subject the Companies to licensing requirement even if they engage in trivial amounts of business with New York residents. A single New York customer would be sufficient to subject each of the Companies to the full suite of regulatory requirements under the BitLicense Proposal. § 200.2(n). </p>

						<p class="intro">This provision could severely impede the development of virtual currency businesses outside of New York. If the proposal were already in effect, without the NYDFS’s prior approval, BTC China could not have rolled out its mobile exchange for virtual currency in China; Huobi could not have acquired a Chinese provider of virtual currency storage services; and OKCoin could not have launched an international version of its trading platform. §§ 200.10–11. The Companies would also be required to, among other things, submit as a part of their BitLicense applications fingerprints of all employees (most of whom are Chinese citizens) to the U.S.  Federal Bureau of Investigation. § 200.4(a)(5).</p>

							Comments to the New York Department of Financial Services on the Proposed Virtual Currency Regulatory Framework
						</div>
						<div class="author">

							Jerry Brito, CoinCenter and Eli Dourado, Mercatus Center at George Mason University
						</div>
						<p class="intro">
								 ...it is important that the department approach the regulation of cryptocurrency firms with due sensitivity to the dynamics of software firms. Because the software industry is so different from the financial
								industry, those differences must be explicitly taken into account in the BitLicense framework. In some cases, these accommodations may represent a change in the way that the department has operated, but we maintain that the
								benefits justify the cost... </p>

						<p class="intro">As we have noted, the current draft regulations miss the mark in two ways. First, although they laudably take into account some of the unique characteristics of virtual currency firms, they do not accommodate some other impor- tant aspects of new cryptocurrency technology. We have suggested some ways in which the proposed regulations could be improved in this regard. Second, BitLicense compliance should be no more burdensome than that of transmission of money licenses. We have noted several of the differences between these two kinds of licenses, and we ask the department to reconsider those aspects that make the virtual currency regulations more burdensome.</p>

							Strevus Comment on NY BitLicense Proposal
						</div>
						<div class="author">
							<!--<img src="https://www.circle.com/marketing/images/headshots/headshot-allaire.png" class="avatar" alt="author" />-->
							John Bliss, Strevus
						</div>
						<p class="intro">
								To promote innovation in the digital currency ecosystem, and ensure a continued, vibrant New York-based digital currency community, DFS should consider implementation of well-established regulatory tools such as minimum thresholds, transition periods and safe harbors. We appreciate DFS’s desire to promote innovation in the digital currency arena. We further appreciate that that innovation goal must be balanced with an equally important consumer protection interest. </p>

						<p class="intro">So, the question must be asked: How can a digital currency regulatory body enable small seed or venture-backed startups to innovate under a compliance regime that is admittedly daunting? Or, for that matter, major financial institutions and multinational businesses with an AML compliance budget far beyond the entire capitalization of these startups. In this instance, public policy objectives might require market incentives. A well-worn approach adopted by US federal regulators in other circumstances has been to utilize safe harbors and similar tools to promote important policy objectives. Accordingly, we agree with the suggestion offered by Mercatus Comments at 10-11 and others – that is, to amend the BitLicense Proposal’s Exemption section (Sec. 200.3 (c)) to include a Safe Harbor against claims of BitLicense proposal violation where the Safe Harbored Licensee (1) can demonstrate its revenues fell below a minimum financial or deposits-on hand threshold, (2) can commit to register with FINCEN and fully comply with its AML and KYC requirements, and (3) has not been the subject of any consumer complaints.</p>

							Perianne M. Boring, Chamber for Digital Commerce
						</div>
						<p class="intro">
								The BitLicense Proposal raises some very serious concerns. If adopted as is, the proposal will require companies with only tenuous connection with New York to obtain a license, impose blunt rules to solve imaginary risks, potentially cripple innovation with prohibitive compliance costs, and possibly severely injure the New York technology sector. Fundamentally, the proposal treats the virtual currency industry as a mature space where the “usuals” and the “long-settled” roam, while the opposite is true. As entrepreneurs race to unlock the potential of virtual currency and the underlying blockchain technology, no one canbe sure about the landscape of the industry years into the future and future attendant risks. Forcing a fine-grain framework at this time would amount to a self-deceiving gesture flung in the face of a fledgling vulnerable industry...</p>

						<p class="intro">While the NYDFS expects virtual currency businesses to adopt a “risk-based” approach for compliance efforts, it has failed to do the same with this indiscriminate BitLicense Proposal. It is unjustifiable why small virtual currency start-ups should be regulated in substantially the same way as the largest businesses in the industry.</p>

							Extension Letter to the New York Department of Financial Services

							Austin Walne, StartBitcoin, signed by major Bitcoin CEOs, developers, and investors
						</div>
						<p class="intro">
								We seek to have all members of the bitcoin community play an active part in submitting thoughtful comments in response to the New York Department of Financial Services rulemaking under Title 23, Part 200: Virtual Currencies or “BitLicense.” Having reviewed the proposal, the undersigned hereby request a minimum 45-day extension to the deadline for filing public comment on the proposed Department of Financial Services rules expected to be published in the New York Registrar on July 23rd, 2014 pursuant to the published guidelines on the NY Department of State website requiring a statutory minimum of 45 or 60 days with additional 30 day period when substantial changes are required.</p>
						<p class="intro">We believe an extension is necessary if stakeholders and interested parties are to have adequate opportunity to provide constructive feedback on both the broad scope and detailed components of the proposed rules materially impacting an entire nascent industry. Many of us are individuals or small startups operating on limited budgets without access to extensive legal resources. This imposes a substantial burden as we seek to understand the proposed rules and their current and future impacts on our businesses, open-source projects, and educational research.</p>

							Ryan Selkis, Bitcoin Entreprenuer &amp; Journalist
						</div>
						<p class="intro">
								I believe that the NYDFS could more appropriately regulate new virtual currency issuances by simply requiring the “BitLicensed” organizations responsible for currency exchange and custodianship to demonstrate reasonable, good faith diligence efforts surrounding the viability and integrity of any new virtual currencies available on their platforms.  For example, a New York-based exchange might face limitations on the type of virtual currencies for which they make markets, based on those currencies’  respective market capitalizations and daily trading volumes.</p>

						<p class="intro">This approach would not eliminate global trading platforms that make markets for thinly traded virtual currencies, but it would establish New York State as a haven for the exchange of much safer and thoroughly vetted virtual currencies.  Furthermore, this approach would allow new virtual currencies to operate unencumbered in their “beta” forms, while creating a firewall between unsophisticated investors and high-risk new issuances.  This would appear to be the virtual currency analog of security listings and de-listings that already occurs every day on regulated stock exchanges.</p>

>Dear Superintendent Lawsky,

I am writing as a concerned member of the Bitcoin community about New York’s proposed “BitLicense" regulations. The proposed regulations as they stand do not accomplish New York’s goal of becoming a center for financial innovation. Instead, they will push Bitcoin startups and innovators outside of New York State.
Many major Bitcoin companies have already said that they will have no choice but to block New York IP addresses if BitLicense is implemented as it currently stands. The regulations suffer from many problems, but I’d like to highlight three major ones.

(1) BitLicense is technology-specific regulation. It is analogous to regulating email different from instant messages, both ways of communicating on the internet. This technology-specific approach can serve to disadvantage one technology over another with additional burdens and will stifle the Bitcoin ecosystem.

(2) BitLicense makes no room for small businesses and startups to operate in the Bitcoin ecosystem. One of the things that is most powerful about Bitcoin is its ability to let anyone build new financial technology. NYDFS should create a safe harbor that allows for innovators in the field to create new uses, rewarding them for good behavior without fear of liability.

(3) BitLicense will hurt New York. Unless it is drastically changed, it will drive new financial innovation out of New York and move it to other states or other countries. We are already witnessing other states and jurisdictions propose friendlier approaches. I urge you to take a dramatically different approach in your second draft, one that incorporates existing regulations and limits their scope to custodial money transmitters and exchanges. New York needs Bitcoin.

Sincerely,
